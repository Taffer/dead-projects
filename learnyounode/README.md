# learnyounode

I've done a bunch of client-side JavaScript, and wanted to learn Node.js; I'm tossing
this up here so I can use bioHound's analysis tools to learn _right_.

If you're developing in JavaScript, you should definitely check out [bitHound](https://www.bithound.io/).

Once I figure out the community-accepted coding standards/code style for Node.js development,
I'll list it here, as well as any lint or code analysis tools I find useful.

## bitHound Score

Nice, I had a score of 99 on my initial import. Here's my badge, I think this
will update dynamically whenever I check in something:
