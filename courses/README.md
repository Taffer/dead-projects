# Courses

Code whipped off while taking interesting courses.

This code might be horrible and not up to my usual coding standards. I've been taking interesting courses, mostly on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), to fill in CS gaps and to learn more about topics like cryptography... and I do these in my copious spare time, so sometimes I just need to hack up an assignment as quickly as possible.

You're most likely to find Python in here, unless the course is focused on a specific language.

## What's here?

Source code implementing the assignments for:

* `algs-1` - [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)
* `algs-2` - [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2)
* `c++4c` - [C++ for C Programmers](https://www.coursera.org/course/cplusplus4c); I've known C++ since the 90s, but wanted a refresher... haven't used it in ages.
* `crypto-1` - Dan Boneh's [Cryptography 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto)
* `crypto-2` - Dan Boneh's Cryptography 2 *Coming soon!*
* `crypto-um` - Jonathan Katz' [Cryptography](https://www.coursera.org/course/cryptography); why take another one? Well, I've grown rusty since taking _Cryptography 1_ and wanted to brush up in case _Cryptography 2_ happens.
* `software-security` - [Software Security](https://www.coursera.org/course/softwaresec)

**WARNING:** I've included the data files used for the assignments because I'm lazy; some of them are quite large (which, frankly, is more of an issue for my anaemic DSL than your download).

## Using the code

Do your own homework. But feel free to look at (and possibly be horrified by) my code; maybe it'll help if you get stuck.
