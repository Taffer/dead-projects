Course Overview

- crypto to protect data
- SSL: handshake to make a shared secret key, data encoded using secret key
- never use proprietary ciphers
- crypto won't protect against software bugs or social engineering

What is cryptography?

- establish a secret key, use it to secure communication (confidentiality,
  integrity)
- digital signatures
- anonymous communication (mix net - sequence of crypto proxies)
- anonymous digital cash
- Theorem: Anything that can be done with a trusted authority can also be
           done without one.
- privately outsourcing computation
- zero knowledge (proof of knowledge)
- three steps:
  1) precisely specify threat model
  2) propose a construction
  3) prove that breaking the construction under the threat model will solve
     an underlying hard problem

History of cryptography

- substitution cipher - 26! key space ~= 2^88, 88-bit
- Caesar chiper - not really a cipher, no key... rot-3
- breaking substitution cipher: freq. of letters, freq. of pairs of letters
  (digrams); vulnerable to ciphertext-only attack (the easiest)
- Vigener cipher; easy to break if you know key length; ciphertext-only attack
- rotor machines, like Enigma; ciphertext-only attack at Bletchley Park
- DES (56-bit key, 64-bit bock size), AES (128-bit key), Salsa20

Discrete probability

- U: finite set, eg. U = { 0,1 } ^n
- probability distrubtion P over U is a function P: U -> [0,1] such that
  the (sum of all the weights)P(x) = 1
  - Uniform distribution: all weights of U: P(x) = 1/|U|
    (every element in the set has the same weight or distribution)
  - Point distribution at x0: P(x0) = 1, all x != x0: P(x) = 0
    (all probability in P(x0), all other points get 0 probability)
- distribution vector: p(0), p(1), ... p(n)
- if A is a subset of U, the probably of A is the sum of the probability of
  the items in A; this is called an event
- union bound, for events A1 and A2, the probability of the union is <= the
  sum of the probably of A1 and A2

Theorem: given A, a random variable over { 0, 1 } ^n and X an independent
         uniform variable over { 0, 1 } ^n, then y:=A xor X is a uniform
         variable on { 0, 1 } ^n
