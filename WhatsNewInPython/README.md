What's New in Python
====================

An ePub formatted collection of the various "What's New in Python"
documents found on the [Python website](http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/index.html).

Why?
----

I realized I hadn't used Python since around when 2.0 was released, and I wanted
a handy collection of the changes introduced since then. Since I've got an e-reader,
ePub was the obvious choice.

The HTML files here are just the various "What's New" pages saved from my browser.
