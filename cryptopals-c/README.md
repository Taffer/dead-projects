# cryptopals-c

[Crypto Challenge](http://cryptopals.com/) but implemented in C so I can get
my mad skillz back.

I used to be good at C, and Makefiles. I'd like to get those skills back for my
new job... and learn some new tools like `cppcheck`, `scons`, and the Unity
unit test framework.

If you're at all interested in cryptography and programming, you should check
out the [Crypto Challenge](http://cryptopals.com/) website and play along!
