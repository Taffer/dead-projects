# cryptopals

Code created while working through the Matasano Crypto Challenges

If you'd like to play along, you should probably ignore the code in here (due to spoilers). Instead, go to:

* [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)

Directories:

* `cryptopals` - Python Cryptopals module; the generally useful and reusable methods created while working through the Challenge.
* `set1` - Python scripts implementing specific challenges.

Excellent cryptography course:

* [Dan Boneh's Cryptography I course](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto), free on Coursera, highly recommended.
* [Dan Boneh's Cryptography II course](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto2), if it ever happens.
